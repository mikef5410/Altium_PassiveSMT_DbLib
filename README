This library uses SQLite3, so you need to install a "data source" for SQLite3
before you can use it. You can get it from: http://www.ch-werner.de/sqliteodbc/

In particular, you want: http://www.ch-werner.de/sqliteodbc/sqliteodbc.exe

Install it, and re-start Altium.

The connection to the SQLite3 database is done in PassiveSMT.DbLib ... you may
need to edit the ConnectionString ... it should read:

ConnectionString=DSN=SQLite3 Datasource;Database=Z:\root\projects\MF_CAD\PassiveSMT\PassiveSMT.db

Note the full path to the Sqlite database file. You'll probably need to change
this.

Next, add the DbLib file to your project or install it as a library.

Right now, we've got all 1% values of 0201, 0402, 0603, 0805, and 1206 TDK
resistors with Digi-Key ordering info.

Then, there's a whole bunch of TDK MLC capacitors ... 0201 -> 2220's

Then, there's a whole bunch of TDK Ceramic inductors ... 0201, 0402, and 0603

Then, there's the whole T491 series of Kemet surface mount tantalums.

The schema uses fixed size varchars because for some reason text fields result
in all data being "WideMemo". Dunno why. Guess it's a windows thing. The
Scripts directory has all the code I used to load up the tables.
